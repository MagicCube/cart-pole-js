## About CartPole Game

The [CartPole](https://github.com/openai/gym/wiki/CartPole-v0) game is the classic 'Hello World' for [Reinforcement Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning).
A pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along the ground.
The system is controlled by applying a force vector of [+1, 0] or [-1, 0] to the cart.
A slight but random pendulum starts immediately after the game begins, and the goal is to prevent the pole from falling down.
